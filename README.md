Technologies:
Java 8,
Maven,
Junit

I have created a Sevice class called ServiceManager which has below 3 methods:

createEntity(long id, String name)
deleteEntity(Entity entity)
createEntities(Map<Long, String> entities)

To verify these functionalities, a Junit class called TestExercise and few junit test cases has been created

Future Enhancement:
Add few more test cases,
Use Jenkins job to execute test cases.
